          My name is Tom Rago. I am a self-taught web developer. I started
          learning about three years ago. I was stuck in a dead-end job and was
          not very happy with where my career was going. I searched and searched
          on the internet to find a career I could learn on my own. There were
          decent jobs that I found, but nothing I was interested in. Then web
          development caught my eye. I was always interested in technology and
          the web, so I figured I'd give it a shot. After reading up on others
          that have switched careers to web development, I found that it was
          possible. It was inspiring. If I put in the hard work and tried my
          best, I could finally have a career I was proud of and make a great
          living for myself. I've taken courses online such as Udemy,
          Codeacademy, and Treehouse. I found that Udemy was the best learning
          tool for me and wasn't expensive at all. They have great teachers, and
          if you have any questions about the course or run into any problems,
          they'll respond rather swiftly. I've learned HTML, CSS, Javascript,
          React, Redux, Nodejs, and many more libraries/frameworks. I enjoy
          creating websites and would love to make it my new career. All I need
          is someone to give me a chance and I know I'll become a great asset to
          any company willing to give me the opportunity.
