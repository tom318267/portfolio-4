          My name is Tom Rago. I am a self-taught web developer. I started
          learning about three years ago. I was stuck in a dead-end job and
          wasn’t very happy with where my career was going. I searched and
          searched on the internet to find a career I could learn on own. There
          were decent jobs that I found, but nothing I was interested in. Then
          web development caught my eye. I was always interested in technology
          and the web, so I figured I would give it a shot. After reading up on
          others that have switched careers to web development, I found that it
          was possible. It was inspiring. If I put in the hard work and tried my
          best, I could finally have a career I was proud of and make a great
          living for myself.I have taken courses online such as Udemy,
          Codeacademy, and Treehouse. I found that Udemy was the best learning
          tool for me and was not expensive at all. They have great teachers,
          and if you have any questions about the course or run into any
          problems, they will respond rather swiftly. I have learned HTML, CSS,
          Javascript, React, Redux, Nodejs, and many more libraries/frameworks.
          I enjoy creating websites and would love to make it my new career. All
          I need is someone to give me a chance and I know I will become a great
          asset to any company willing to give me the opportunity.
