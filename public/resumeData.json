    "bio": "My name is Tom Rago, I am a self-taught web developer. I started learning about three years ago. I was stuck in a dead-end job and wasnâ€™t very happy with where my career was going. I searched and searched on the internet to find a career I could learn on own. There were decent jobs that I found, but nothing I was interested in. Then web development caught my eye. I was always interested in technology and the web, so I figured I would give it a shot. After reading up on others that have switched careers to web development, I found that it was possible. It was inspiring. If I put in the hard work and tried my best, I could finally have a career I was proud of and make a great living for myself.I have taken courses online such as Udemy, Codeacademy, and Treehouse. I found that Udemy was the best learning tool for me and was not expensive at all. They have great teachers, and if you have any questions about the course or run into any problems, they will respond rather swiftly. I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Redux, Nodejs, and many more libraries/frameworks. I enjoy creating websites and would love to make my new career. All I need is someone to give me a chance and I know I will become a great asset to any company willing to give me the opportunity.",
